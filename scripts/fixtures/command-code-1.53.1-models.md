# Command Code Models

The model catalog — every id `/model`, `--model`, `model:effort` shorthand, and agent-file `model:` pinning accept, with context windows, reasoning efforts, and advertised per-1M-token rates. Ids are EXACT — never invent or guess a model id. A BYO-provider id (from a configured custom provider) also works and is passed through as-is.

Rates are the advertised price list resolved from the billing source of truth (promos are already baked in): input / output / cache-read per 1M tokens, plus cache-write where the provider bills it. Min plan is the cheapest public plan that serves the model, ordered Go < GOAT < Pro < Max (see plans.md). Models without an effort column entry decide their own reasoning depth.
